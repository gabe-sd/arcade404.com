// What a Minesweeper cell shows, and what the readout shows.
//
// Both used to be emoji written into textContent, which the OS font drew in its
// own colours - the one thing on the page the site's palette could not reach.
// They are drawn SVG now, so what is worth guarding is that a cell says which
// mark it is carrying, that a dead board distinguishes the mine you hit from
// the nine beside it, and that no emoji has crept back in.
//
// The marks are read through data-mark rather than by comparing path markup:
// the browser rewrites `<path/>` as `<path></path>`, so a test doing that would
// be measuring the serialiser. Chess's pieces carry data-piece for the same
// reason.

// flag and the bomb. The floor starts at the arrows, which the typeface does
// not carry either - the footer's GitHub arrow is drawn now, so a text one
// coming back is a regression. It stays above the dashes and the middot on
// purpose: those are the site's own typography, used in prose across the site,
// and a sweep that flags them is a sweep nobody will keep.
