# TODO

Known gaps and unscheduled work. Not a changelog — anything done and merged
belongs in git history, not here, so delete entries as they land.

Keep entries actionable: enough context to start without rediscovering the
constraints, including whatever was non-obvious the first time round.

Within a section, entries are in priority order. The first one is what to do next.

Each game keeps its own backlog in its own folder, beside its `DESIGN.md`:
`games/pong/TODO.md`, `games/minesweeper/TODO.md`. A game with no such file has
no open work recorded. That split is what lets several agents work at once —
see "Shared ground" in `CLAUDE.md`, and `WORKER.md`.

What stays here is everything belonging to no single game: the naming rules
below, games that do not exist yet, and site-wide work.

## Naming entries

Every entry is headed by a slug — the game, then **the work**:
`pong-difficulty-menu`, not `pong-difficulty`. Areas recur and get revisited; a
specific piece of work happens once, which is what keeps slugs from colliding.

The slug is also the branch name, so it lands in the merge commit and one string
retrieves the entry, the discussion and the implementation:

```bash
grep -rn "<slug>" .               # the entry, and anything referring to it
git log --all --grep="<slug>"     # the work itself, once it has landed
```

Run both before inventing a slug. Nothing else is needed: git is the record of
retired slugs, so there is no list to maintain, and a slug that did somehow repeat
still describes what it names in both places.

Work on how the repo is run rather than on the site takes a `workflow-` prefix and
belongs in the `## Workflow` section at the end of this file, which says who acts
on it. Work on how the site looks belongs in `design/TODO.md` rather than here,
for the same reason a game's own work belongs in its folder: it has an owner and a
seat of its own.

## Game ideas

**This is an ideas list, not a backlog.** Nothing here is scheduled, scoped or
agreed — an entry is a game somebody thought would be worth having, and that is
all it is. Before building one, take it to Gabriel: what it should do, how big it
is and whether it is next are all his calls. Entries here are not in priority
order, and a slug only becomes real work once it has an entry with constraints in
it.

### reaction-time-game — Reaction time test

### chimp-memory-game — Chimp memory test

See the Human Benchmark version for the shape of it.

### Added 2026-09-15, by Gabriel, no detail yet

- Wordle
- Scrabble
- Asteroids (the Atari one)
- Galaga
- Solitaire
- Spider solitaire
- Breakout
- Crossword puzzles

## Site-wide

Work on how the site **looks** is not here. It belongs to the art director, and
its backlog is `design/TODO.md`, beside the design itself in `design/DESIGN.md`.
See `ART-DIRECTOR.md` for the seat.

### site-framework-migration — Decide whether the site moves to a framework

**Big, and not a coding task until it has been decided.** Raised by Gabriel on
2026-09-15: the question is whether to migrate before the site is built out much
further, because every game added raises the cost of moving later.

`CLAUDE.md` currently rules a build step out — no framework, no build, one
dependency, files served as-is — and that is the thing this entry is asking to
revisit, not something to work around. So this is a decision first: what a
framework would buy at this size, what it would cost (the page contract, the
classic-script testing affordance that lets the suite call `restart()` and read
`grid` directly, and the "no build step" deploy straight from the repo all
depend on the current shape), and what would have to change in the docs.

**Gabriel's note, 2026-09-15:** maybe wait until meetgabe.dev is done — that may
get a simple framework, and the experience there would be worth having before
taking this on.

Nothing starts here without him saying so.

### highscore-backend — A backend for stored values

Everything is `localStorage` today, so nothing is shared between devices or
players. A high score table is the obvious first thing that needs a server, and
also the first thing that would break the "no build, no dependencies, files served
as-is" property the site has now. Worth planning before it is wanted.

Two more things Gabriel wants from the same server, from his notes: a global
visit counter for the site, and a play count for each game. Start with the
simplest of these.

## Cloudflare migration

The site moved off GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Workers, which serves the repo root
as static assets. The move itself is done and live; what is here is the part that
was left at whatever the default did, rather than chosen.

### cloudflare-public-directory — The served files are the repo, not a subdirectory

`wrangler.jsonc` points the worker at the repo root, so the served tree and the
working tree are the same thing and `.assetsignore` is what keeps the two apart.
The usual shape is a subdirectory — everything a visitor can fetch inside it,
everything else outside — which makes the boundary structural rather than a list
that has to be kept current.

The cost is spread thin rather than deep. `wrangler.jsonc` changes one line and
`.assetsignore` mostly empties out, but the serve script and `tests/run-all.js`
both root a server at the checkout and would need pointing a level down, and
`tests/docs-check.js` and `tests/contract.test.js` both find the games by reading
`games/` from the root.

Decide first whether a game folder moves whole. `CLAUDE.md` says a game lives
entirely in `games/<name>/`, and that is what keeps two agents out of one file; a
split that leaves `DESIGN.md` and `TODO.md` behind while the three page files move
would break it for a tidiness the `.assetsignore` line already buys.

## Workflow

How the work is run, rather than what the site does: the seat split, the merge
rules, and the conventions in `CLAUDE.md`, `WORKER.md` and `INTEGRATOR.md`. An
entry here starts life as a **WORKFLOW ISSUE:** raised out loud during a session,
which is why the prefix is `workflow-` and not `site-` — the flag and the slug are
the same thing at two stages.

**If you are a worker, this is not your backlog.** Read it freely; it is often
where the reason behind a rule is written down. But do not take work from it.
Every entry here lands
in `CLAUDE.md`, in a seat file, or in the checks behind them — all the
integrator's, and the first two only after review with Gabriel. A worker fixing
one is rewriting the rules it is working under. If a rule bites you, that is not
a task to pick up — say so at the time, marked **WORKFLOW ISSUE:**, which is what
puts an entry here in the first place.
